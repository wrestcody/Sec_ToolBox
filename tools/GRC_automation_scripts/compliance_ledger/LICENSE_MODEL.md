## 🔐 **License Enforcement Strategy**

### **1. Feature Gating**
```python
class LicenseManager:
    def check_feature_access(self, feature_name: str, usage_metrics: Dict) -> bool:
        """Check if user has access to specific feature based on license."""
        if self.license_type == "open_source":
            return self._check_open_source_limits(feature_name, usage_metrics)
        elif self.license_type == "professional":
            return self._check_professional_limits(feature_name, usage_metrics)
        elif self.license_type == "enterprise":
            return True  # Enterprise has unlimited access
```

### **2. Usage Tracking**
```python
class UsageTracker:
    def track_evidence_collection(self, bundle_count: int):
        """Track evidence bundle collection for licensing."""
        self.monthly_usage['evidence_bundles'] += bundle_count
        
    def check_limits(self) -> bool:
        """Check if usage is within license limits."""
        if self.license_type == "open_source":
            return self.monthly_usage['evidence_bundles'] <= 100
        elif self.license_type == "professional":
            return self.monthly_usage['evidence_bundles'] <= 10000
        return True  # Enterprise unlimited
```

### **3. Feature Flags**
```python
FEATURE_FLAGS = {
    "open_source": {
        "advanced_ai": False,
        "framework_mapping": False,
        "real_time_monitoring": False,
        "cloud_storage": False,
        "custom_integrations": False
    },
    "professional": {
        "advanced_ai": True,
        "framework_mapping": True,
        "real_time_monitoring": False,
        "cloud_storage": True,
        "custom_integrations": False
    },
    "enterprise": {
        "advanced_ai": True,
        "framework_mapping": True,
        "real_time_monitoring": True,
