# Secure LLM Interaction Proxy (PoC)
## Compliance-Ready Implementation with Comprehensive Audit Trail

### Overview

This is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for a secure proxy that acts as an intermediary layer between users and Large Language Models (LLMs). The proxy implements comprehensive security and privacy measures with detailed audit logging for compliance and regulatory reporting purposes.

### ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**This is a PoC implementation with enhanced security measures and audit capabilities. It is designed for educational, research, and compliance demonstration purposes. For production use, additional security measures, testing, and compliance validation are required.**

### Purpose and Compliance Focus

The proxy addresses critical security and privacy concerns while providing comprehensive audit trails for:

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOX, ISO 27001
2. **Security Auditing**: Detailed logs of all security events and processing steps
3. **Risk Assessment**: Structured risk analysis with compliance impact mapping
4. **Incident Response**: Comprehensive event tracking for security incidents
5. **Compliance Reporting**: Automated generation of compliance status reports

### Security Risks in LLM Interactions

#### Prompt Injection Attacks
- **System Prompt Override**: Attempts to make the LLM ignore its original instructions
- **Role Confusion**: Trying to make the LLM act as a different entity
- **Instruction Bypass**: Attempts to override safety measures
- **Compliance Impact**: ISO 27001, SOX

#### Privacy Risks
- **PII Exposure**: Accidental sharing of personal information in prompts
- **Data Leakage**: LLM responses containing sensitive information
- **Conversation History**: Persistent storage of sensitive conversations
- **Compliance Impact**: GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS

#### Content Risks
- **Harmful Content**: Generation of malicious code, instructions, or content
- **Bias Amplification**: Reinforcement of harmful biases
- **Misinformation**: Generation of false or misleading information
- **Compliance Impact**: ISO 27001, industry-specific regulations
