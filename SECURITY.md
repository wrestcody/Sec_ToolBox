# Security Policy

## Our Commitment to Security

Given that this repository is public and aims to demonstrate secure coding practices, any security vulnerabilities found within the code are taken extremely seriously. We are committed to ensuring that this repository serves as a positive example of security-first development practices.

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| main    | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository, please report it responsibly by:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability in public forums or social media
3. **DO** send an email to [your.security.email@domain.com] with:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### What to Expect

When you report a security vulnerability, you can expect:

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress at least weekly
- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 7 days and other vulnerabilities within 30 days
- **Credit**: With your permission, we will acknowledge your contribution in the fix

### Vulnerability Severity Classification

We use the following severity classification:

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation to system administrator
- Authentication bypass in core functionality

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Data exposure vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation to application administrator
- SQL injection or similar injection attacks

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- Information disclosure of sensitive data
- Denial of service vulnerabilities

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Information disclosure of non-sensitive data
- Minor logic flaws
- Cosmetic security issues

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Contributions

When contributing to this repository, please ensure:

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are properly validated and sanitized
2. **Output Encoding**: All outputs are properly encoded to prevent injection attacks
3. **Authentication & Authorization**: Proper access controls are implemented
4. **Secure Defaults**: Default configurations are secure
5. **Error Handling**: Errors don't expose sensitive information
6. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities

### Sensitive Data Handling

- **Never commit secrets**: No API keys, passwords, tokens, or other secrets in code
- **Use environment variables**: For configuration data that might be sensitive
- **Sanitize logs**: Ensure logs don't contain sensitive information
- **Data minimization**: Only collect and process data that is necessary

### Testing Security

- Run static analysis security testing (SAST) tools
- Perform dependency vulnerability scanning
- Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Validate input handling and error conditions

## Security Tools and Automation

This repository uses several automated security tools:

### Static Analysis
- **Bandit**: Python security linter for identifying common security issues
- **Safety**: Checks Python dependencies for known security vulnerabilities
- **Semgrep**: Multi-language static analysis for security patterns

### Dependency Scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates for security patches
- **pip-audit**: Python package vulnerability scanner

### Secrets Detection
- **git-secrets**: Prevents committing secrets to git repositories
- **detect-secrets**: Identifies potential secrets in code

## Incident Response

In the event of a confirmed security vulnerability:

1. **Immediate Response** (0-24 hours)
   - Acknowledge the report
   - Assess the severity and impact
   - Begin developing a fix

2. **Short-term Response** (1-7 days)
   - Develop and test a security patch
   - Prepare security advisory
   - Coordinate with the reporter

3. **Long-term Response** (7-30 days)
   - Release the security patch
   - Publish security advisory
   - Update documentation and processes
   - Conduct post-incident review

## Security Contact Information

- **Primary Contact**: [your.security.email@domain.com]
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's security advisory feature for coordinated disclosure
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond to all security reports within 24 hours

## Legal and Responsible Disclosure

### Legal Protections

We support security researchers and will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions to others
- Only interact with systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Don't access or modify data belonging to others
- Report vulnerabilities promptly and work with us to resolve them

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow the principles of coordinated disclosure:

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will not publicly disclose the vulnerability until a fix is available
- We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to fix it
