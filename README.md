## 🎯 Mission Statement

Guardians Armory is a **comprehensive security tooling framework** that implements **The Guardian's Mandate** - a foundational principle for building systems with unassailable digital evidence integrity and unbreakable chain of custody. This framework ensures that all security tools, audit trails, and forensic evidence meet the most stringent compliance and legal requirements.

> **"To Create the Next Generation of Protectors"**

### 🏆 **Why This Project Stands Out**

| Feature | Description | Impact |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 🔐 **Cryptographic Integrity** | SHA-256+ hashing with blockchain-style verification | Legal-grade evidence |
| 🎯 **GRC Automation** | Automated compliance mapping & evidence collection | Enterprise-ready |
| 🤖 **AI Integration** | MCP server for secure AI assistant integration | Future-proof |
| ☁️ **Multi-Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP security assessment tools | Comprehensive |
| 📊 **Forensic Ready** | Standardized export with cryptographic proofs | Investigation-ready |

## 🛡️ The Guardian's Mandate

The Guardian's Mandate is built on four core principles:

### 1. 🔐 **Cryptographic Tamper-Evident Logging & Data**
- SHA-256+ hashing for all critical events
- Verifiable timestamps cryptographically bound to data
- Immutable, append-only data structures

### 2. 🔗 **Automated & Granular Chain of Custody**
- Every interaction automatically logged with full context
- Robust IAM policies with least privilege principle
- Session recording for privileged user actions

### 3. 📋 **Verifiable Ledger for Integrity**
- Blockchain-style verification of critical events
- Cryptographic chain linking each event to the previous
- Regular integrity checkpoints for forensic purposes

### 4. 🔍 **Forensic Readiness & Auditability by Design**
- Standardized forensic data export with cryptographic proofs
- Independent verification tools for integrity validation
- Compliance alignment with NIST, ISO 27001, SOC 2, and legal standards

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

- **🕵️ GuardianLedger**: Immutable, cryptographically-secured audit ledger
- **🚨 IAM Anomaly Detector**: Cloud IAM behavioral anomaly detection with Guardian's Mandate integration
- **🔐 Cryptographic Proof System**: SHA-256+ hashing with RSA digital signatures
- **📋 Chain of Custody Tracking**: Complete traceability of all evidence
- **📤 Forensic Export System**: Standardized, machine-readable forensic data export
- **🤖 GRC MCP Server**: Secure AI integration with bidirectional accessibility

### Evidence Integrity Levels

| Level | Use Case | Requirements |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| 🔴 **CRITICAL** | Financial data, PII, security events | Cryptographic proofs required |
| 🟡 **HIGH** | Configuration changes, access logs | Hashing and timestamping |
| 🟢 **MEDIUM** | System events, performance metrics | Basic logging |
| ⚪ **LOW** | Informational logs, debug data | Informational only |
