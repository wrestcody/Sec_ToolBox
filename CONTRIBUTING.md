## Security Requirements for All Contributions

### Mandatory Security Practices

#### 1. Secure Coding Standards
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs, especially user-provided data
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode outputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication where required
- **Authorization**: Follow principle of least privilege
- **Cryptography**: Use established cryptographic libraries, never roll your own

#### 2. Secrets Management
- **Never commit secrets**: No API keys, passwords, tokens, or certificates
- **Use environment variables**: For sensitive configuration data
- **Document secret requirements**: Clearly document what secrets are needed
- **Provide examples**: Use placeholder values in example configurations

#### 3. Dependency Security
- **Keep dependencies updated**: Use latest stable versions
- **Scan for vulnerabilities**: Run `pip-audit` or similar tools
- **Minimize dependencies**: Only include necessary packages
- **Pin versions**: Use specific version numbers in requirements files

#### 4. Data Protection
- **Data minimization**: Only collect necessary data
- **Anonymization**: Remove or mask PII when possible
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- **Retention**: Follow data retention best practices

### Security Review Process

All contributions undergo security review:

1. **Automated Scanning**: CI/CD pipeline runs security tools
2. **Manual Review**: Security-focused code review by maintainers
3. **Testing**: Security testing of new functionality
4. **Documentation**: Security considerations documented

## Privacy Requirements

### Data Handling Principles

#### 1. Privacy by Design
- **Proactive**: Consider privacy from the design phase
- **Default**: Privacy should be the default setting
- **Built-in**: Privacy measures should be integral, not add-ons
- **End-to-End**: Secure data throughout entire lifecycle
- **Visibility**: Ensure all operations are transparent
- **Respect**: Respect user privacy and data subject rights

#### 2. Data Minimization
- **Collection**: Only collect data necessary for functionality
- **Processing**: Only process data for stated purposes
- **Retention**: Delete data when no longer needed
- **Sharing**: Share minimal data with third parties

#### 3. Anonymization and Pseudonymization
- **Remove PII**: Strip personally identifiable information
- **Use synthetic data**: Generate realistic but non-personal test data
- **Aggregate data**: Use statistical summaries when possible
- **Hash identifiers**: Use one-way hashing for necessary identifiers

### Compliance Considerations

Ensure contributions comply with:
- **GDPR**: European data protection regulation
- **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare information protection (where applicable)
- **SOX**: Financial data protection (where applicable)
- **Industry-specific**: Sector-specific privacy requirements

```

### 4. Development Guidelines

#### Code Style
- **Follow PEP 8**: Python style guide compliance
- **Use type hints**: Add type annotations to function signatures
- **Write docstrings**: Document all functions, classes, and modules
- **Comment complex logic**: Explain non-obvious code sections

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests**: Write tests for all new functionality
- **Integration tests**: Test interactions with external systems
- **Security tests**: Include security-focused test cases
- **Documentation tests**: Verify examples in documentation work
