# S3 Public Access Remediation Playbook

## Overview
This playbook addresses the critical security finding: **AWS S3 bucket 'my-critical-data-prod' is publicly accessible and contains PII data**.

## Guardian Priority Score: 10.3/10 (Critical)

### Security Defense Gaps Identified
1. **Data Access Control Gap**: S3 Block Public Access settings disabled/misconfigured
2. **Data Classification & Protection Gap**: PII data stored without appropriate restrictions
3. **Network Segmentation Gap**: Critical data bucket exposed to public internet
4. **Encryption & Security Controls Gap**: Potential lack of encryption for sensitive data
5. **Monitoring & Logging Gap**: Insufficient access logging and monitoring

### Compliance Mapping
- **PCI DSS**: 3.4, 7.1, 9.1
- **CIS AWS**: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22
- **CSA CCM**: CCM-01, CCM-02, CCM-03
- **NIST CSF**: PR.AC-1, PR.AC-3, PR.DS-1

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Python 3.8+ (for automation scripts)

### Immediate Action (Execute within 1 hour)
```bash
# Emergency containment
./scripts/emergency_containment.sh
```

### Full Remediation (Execute within 24 hours)
```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan the changes
terraform plan -var-file="config/production.tfvars"

# Apply the remediation
terraform apply -var-file="config/production.tfvars"
```

## Security Considerations

### Before Execution
- [ ] Verify AWS credentials have appropriate permissions
- [ ] Review and understand all changes in terraform plan
- [ ] Ensure backup/rollback procedures are tested
- [ ] Coordinate with stakeholders for potential service impact

### During Execution
- [ ] Monitor CloudWatch logs for any access issues
- [ ] Verify no legitimate services are affected
- [ ] Check S3 access logs for any blocked legitimate requests

### After Execution
- [ ] Verify all security controls are properly applied
- [ ] Test access for authorized users/roles
- [ ] Validate monitoring and alerting are working
- [ ] Update incident response procedures

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback (if service disruption occurs)
```bash
./scripts/rollback.sh
```

### Verification Steps
1. Test public access to bucket objects
2. Verify bucket policy and public access settings
3. Confirm server-side encryption is enabled
4. Check CloudTrail and S3 access logs
5. Test CloudWatch alarms

## Compliance Documentation

### PCI DSS Controls Addressed
- **3.4**: Render PAN unreadable anywhere it is stored
- **7.1**: Restrict access to cardholder data to need-to-know basis
- **9.1**: Use appropriate facility entry controls

### Audit Trail
All changes are logged in `compliance/audit_trail.md` with timestamps and justifications.

## Support and Escalation

### For Technical Issues
- Check CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages
- Review Terraform state for any failed resources
- Verify AWS service limits and quotas

### For Security Concerns
- Immediately execute rollback if unauthorized access is detected
- Contact security team for incident response
- Review CloudTrail logs for any suspicious activity

## Licensing Model Considerations

### Open-Source Version
- Basic CLI commands for manual remediation
- Guided step-by-step instructions
- Community-driven policy templates

### Commercial Version
- Automated Terraform/CloudFormation playbook generation
- AI-driven risk assessment and prioritization
- Enterprise SIEM/SOAR integration
- Advanced monitoring and alerting
- Dedicated technical support
